# Overview

This program was built to demonstrate a game using Python Arcade with mouse interaction, visual display, and moving sprites. This game is designed as a digital version of Set the card game. To start the program, run the set.py file in terminal. To play the game, select three cards by clicking them with your mouse, looking for three cards that have either all the same or all different of a trait (like shape, color, filling, and number).
